                        <p>Spotify has evolved from a simple music player into a social application, offering a variety of albums, podcasts, and audiobooks from around the world. They have introduced key features like Discover Weekly, Daily Mixes, Release Radar, AI DJ, and Spotify Jam to encourage users to explore the expanding audio library. The current home page design employs an algorithm to encourage exploration of these features and relevant audio content.

                    </p>
                    <p>The action used to initiate a song significantly influences the outcome of the listening session. Features within the streaming platform cater to either discovery or familiar listening experiences. Users' utilization of these features results in varied outcomes, with certain features promoting frequently interrupted listening while others foster a more relaxed, continuous listening experience. This natural bias within the listener shapes the type of session they engage in.

                    <p>Capturing user attention within a music streaming platform involves understanding the interplay between different user actions and their impact on listening behavior. The various actions available to users encourage both active and passive listening experiences, influenced by factors such as discoverability and familiarity with content. Active listening occurs when users actively select and queue music, whereas passive listening involves sequential playback without user interaction.

                        </h3>   
                        <p>We conducted research to understand the various components of a widget and determine which design factors enable people to access the information and features they need quickly. This guided our interface design process, helping us create widgets that effectively present information in a clear and efficient manner.

Leveraging these insights, we refined our features and implemented methods for organizing sessions, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

While widgets offer a promising avenue to boost engagement and personalization within the app, they don't fully support users in exploring diverse content.

By providing customized recommendations directly on the search tab, we can seamlessly capture users' attention before they even begin their search, thus facilitating exploration in conjunction with engagement via utilizing widgets on the home page.

                            <p>To tackle this challenge of enhancing exploration on Spotify, we conducted six interviews focusing on music selection, app usability, usage behavior, exploration habits, and areas for improvement.

                            <p>Upon reviewing our interviews, we revisited how users discover new content. Users discover new music through various channels including Spotify’s Discover Weekly, radios, TikTok, friends, movies, and TV shows, as well as when their favorite artists release music. Methods of discovering music include browsing related artists or songs, finding music online, or through friends playing music in the car.

                            <p>It became evident that most users rely on recommendations from friends or other social media platforms, followed by using the search bar to locate and add content to their libraries.

                    <p>During our research phase, we asked our users to perform tasks designed to assess the intuitiveness of the Spotify app and its various features. Two of the tasks we asked our users to complete were: one focused on creating a blend with a friend, and the other aimed at locating the 'Discover Weekly' playlist—one of Spotify's most popular personalized content recommendations. To further analyze our findings, we created user flow diagrams to illustrate the user interaction with these tasks. Through these tasks, we sought to understand user behaviors, preferences, and pain points within the app's user experience. Our user flow diagrams illustrate the pathways some of our users took to successfully complete these tasks and instances of user failure. Having our users complete these tasks shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of Spotify's UX design to further our design process to address user needs.
